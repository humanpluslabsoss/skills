# Agent Skills

Agent skills are reusable workflows defined in `SKILL.md` files that Claude Code
loads to perform specific development tasks.

This repository centralizes both our in-house workflows and curated third-party
skills, giving projects a consistent place to discover and install the tools used
across planning, implementation, and supporting development work.

## In-House

Install `pnpm` first so that `pnpx` is available, then add the in-house skills to
a project configured for Claude Code:

```bash
pnpx skills@latest add humanpluslabs/skills --agent claude-code
```

### Planning → implementation pipeline

Four skills chain a problem all the way to committed code, starting from whatever
states it — an Asana task, a GitHub issue, or a description typed into the prompt:

```
/start-planning-conversation      read the source + interview to agreement
      ↓
/create-plans-from-conversation   capture + split into self-contained plans
      ↓  (one plan at a time)
/create-prd-from-plan             plan → prd.md + conventions.md
      ↓  (loop until milestones done)
/implement-prd                    next milestone → code, one per session
```

The opening interview is `/grill-me` (see [Matt Pocock](#matt-pocock) below),
invoked by `start-planning-conversation` once it has read the source and scanned
the repo.

| Skill                            | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `start-planning-conversation`    | Reads the problem source — an Asana task, a GitHub issue, or a description typed into the prompt — grounds it in the repo, then runs `/grill-me` to a shared understanding. Conversation only — no plans, no code. |
| `create-plans-from-conversation` | Turns the design decisions in a conversation into one or more self-contained plan files under `docs/plans/`, each shaped to feed `/create-prd-from-plan`. Produces plans only — no PRDs, no code.                  |
| `create-prd-from-plan`           | Turns a plan into an agent-executable PRD (`prd.md`) plus a per-PRD `conventions.md`, breaking work into self-contained milestones a fresh session can implement. Documents only.                                  |
| `implement-prd`                  | Implements the next incomplete milestone from a PRD — one milestone per session, commit when green, no auto-push.                                                                                                  |

### Utilities

| Skill                 | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit`              | Creates a conventional commit message for staged changes.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `create-asana-ticket` | Creates well-formed Asana tickets using a vertical-slice, outcome-focused template and a confirmation-first workflow.                                                                                     |
| `explain`             | Read-only mode: answers questions about the project without changing anything.                                                                                                                            |
| `init-monorepo`       | Bootstraps a fresh TypeScript pnpm monorepo with the house defaults (Biome, cspell, lefthook, Turbo, CI, and more).                                                                                       |
| `knowledge-catalogue` | Sets up and maintains an agent-loadable Open Knowledge Format catalogue under `docs/knowledge/` for durable implemented conventions, data assets, and operational facts.                                  |
| `pr-review-comments`  | Works through a pasted CodeRabbit review on the current PR: verifies each finding, gates on a verdict table, implements, syncs the knowledge base, then resolves/replies on threads and commits + pushes. |
| `pre-pr-review`       | Runs a Greptile CLI review of the latest committed work against the base branch, briefing the review agent with the plan and PRD behind the work.                                                         |
| `prime`               | Familiarises the agent with the project codebase at the start of a new conversation.                                                                                                                      |
